    "description": "\nHazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nWhat: \nIce pellets with a risk of freezing rain transitioning to snow today. \nSnowfall amounts near 15 cm possible by this evening.\nReduced visibility in snow and blowing snow.\n\nWhen: \nToday.\n\nAdditional information: \nInitially patchy freezing rain or ice pellets will transition to more widespread ice pellets early this morning. By late this morning, ice pellets will transition to snow from west to east as temperatures rapidly drop. Strong northwesterly winds gusting up to 60 km/h will also develop near noon resulting in reduced visibility in blowing snow this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
