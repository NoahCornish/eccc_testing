    "description": "\nWinter storm continuing into Thursday.\n\nWhat:\nTotal snowfall amounts of 20 to 30 cm.\nPeak snowfall rates of 2 to 4 cm per hour.\nPoor visibility in heavy snow and local blowing snow.\nRisk of freezing rain.\n\nWhen:\nContinuing into Thursday evening.\n\nAdditional information:\nNortherly winds gusting to 50 km/h will result in areas of blowing snow giving reduced visibility. Snow may become mixed with ice pellets and freezing rain later this afternoon into tonight before changing back to snow by early Thursday morning. If this occurs, snowfall amounts may be reduced. The snow is expected to taper to flurries Thursday evening.\n\nTravel is expected to be very difficult at times. Road closures are possible.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
