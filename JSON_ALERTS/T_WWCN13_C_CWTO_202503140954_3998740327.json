    "description": "\nProlonged freezing rain event is likely, beginning this morning continuing through Saturday.\n\nWhat: \nFreezing rain with ice accumulations of 2 to 5 mm.\n\nWhen:\nPatchy freezing rain this morning into tonight.\nWidespread freezing rain Saturday morning continuing through Saturday afternoon.\n\nAdditional information: \nPatchy freezing rain possibly mixed with ice pellets or snow is expected today. Freezing rain will become heavier and more widespread early Saturday morning, continuing through the afternoon. Freezing rain will change to snow early Saturday evening. There is potential that areas near and south of Pickle Lake could change over to rain during this event, which would limit ice accumulation in these areas.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break. Utility outages may occur.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
    "instruction": "\nConsider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve. Beware of branches or electrical wires that could break under the weight of ice.\n",
