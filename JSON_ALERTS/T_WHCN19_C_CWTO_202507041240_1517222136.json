    "description": "\nConditions are favourable for the development of squalls with wind gusts up to 35 knots, frequent lightning and poor to very poor visibility in thunderstorms heavy at times.\n\n\n###\n\nPoor to very poor visibility may contribute to voyage delays and make marine navigation hazardous. Proceed with caution as visibility may suddenly be reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. For more information monitor Canadian Coast Guard radio or Weatheradio stations.\n",
    "instruction": "\nMariners are advised to prepare for potential squalls. Vulnerable vessels are most at risk and should seek safe harbour if underway. Consider delaying or postponing travel in areas under the Squall Watch.\n",
