Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nWhat:\nReduced visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nPeak snowfall rates of 2 to 4 cm per hour.\nTotal snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm.\n\nWhen:\nThis afternoon and evening.\n\nAdditional Information:\nA strong cold front will move northwest to southeast across the area this afternoon into this evening. A brief but intense line of flurries is expected to develop along the cold front, which will may result in near-zero visibility in heavy snow. Strong northerly wind gusts behind the cold front will also bring reduced visibilities in blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",

Temperatures are expected to quickly plunge below the freezing mark in the wake of the cold front. Any wet surfaces due to snow melt may become icy and slippery.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

            "description": "\nBrief, intense snowfall is expected to develop. Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nWhat:\nReduced visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nPeak snowfall rates of 3 to 5 cm per hour.\nTotal snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm.\n\nWhen:\nThis afternoon and evening.\n\nAdditional Information:\nA strong cold front will move northwest to southeast across the area this afternoon into this evening. A brief but intense line of flurries is expected to develop along the cold front, which will may result in near-zero visibility in heavy snow. Strong northerly wind gusts behind the cold front will also bring reduced visibilities in blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",

Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nWhat:\nNear zero visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nPeak snowfall rates of 3 to 5 cm per hour.\nTotal snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm.\n\nWhen:\nThis afternoon and evening.\n\nAdditional Information:\nA strong cold front will move northwest to southeast across the area this afternoon into this evening. A brief but intense line of flurries is expected to develop along the cold front. Blowing snow can also occur with strong northerly wind gusts behind the cold front.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",

Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nThis frontal snow squall is located from 55 kilometres northwest of Neshin Lake to 15 kilometres east of South Lake, moving east at 50 km/h. \n\nHazard:\nNear zero visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow. \n\nLocations impacted include:\nHearst, Penhurst, Macduff, Boon, Coppell, Ryland, Lac-Ste-Thérèse, Val Côté and Shannon Lake.\n\nAdditional information:\nThe band of snow is expected to be very brief in nature. Sudden whiteout conditions are the main hazard as opposed to snowfall accumulations.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",

Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nWhat:\nNear zero visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nPeak snowfall rates of 3 to 5 cm per hour.\nTotal snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm.\n\nWhen:\nThis afternoon and evening.\n\nAdditional Information:\nA strong cold front will move northwest to southeast across the area this afternoon into this evening. A brief but intense line of flurries is expected to develop along the cold front. Blowing snow can also occur with strong northerly wind gusts behind the cold front.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",

Sudden whiteout conditions are the main hazard as opposed to snowfall accumulations.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nWhat:\nNear zero visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nPeak snowfall rates of 3 to 5 cm per hour.\nTotal snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm.\n\nWhen:\nThis evening.\n\nAdditional Information:\nA strong cold front will move northwest to southeast across the area. A brief but intense line of flurries is expected to develop along the cold front. Blowing snow can also occur with strong northerly wind gusts behind the cold front.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",

Rain is most likely over the North Bay area before the cold front.\n\nWhen:\nTonight into early Saturday morning.\n\nAdditional information:\nA cold front will move through the area tonight. Temperatures are expected to quickly plunge below the freezing mark in the wake of the cold front. Any wet surfaces due to snow melt and rain may become icy and slippery.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
