There is also the potential that southern portions of the region may change over to rain this evening. All precipitation will change over to snow by late Saturday morning, with gusty winds leading to reduced visibility in blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
