    "description": "\nWinter weather travel advisory in effect.\n\nWhat:\nSnowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm.\nPoor visibility in areas of heavier snow.\n\nWhen:\nContinuing into tonight.\n\nAdditional information:\nA low pressure system will bring a narrow band of heavy snow across portions of northern Ontario today. At this point, the axis of the heaviest snowfall is expected to remain north of the region. However, snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are still possible, particularly for areas from near Lake Nipigon towards Kapuskasing, including Highway 11. Precipitation may also become mixed with or change to rain for a period of time.\n\nIf the track of the low pressure system shifts farther south than currently expected, higher snowfall amounts will be possible.\n\n###\n\nMotorists should expect hazardous winter driving conditions and adjust travel plans accordingly.\n\nFor road conditions and other traveller information from the Ministry of Transportation, visit https://www.ontario.ca/511, https://www.twitter.com/511Ontario, or call 5-1-1.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
    "instruction": "\nPrepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions. If visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop.\n",
