    "description": "\nThe first one day heat event of the season is expected.\n\nDaytime highs on Sunday are expected to be near 29 degrees Celsius. Nighttime lows on Sunday night are expected to be near 18 degrees Celsius, providing little relief from the heat. Cooler air is expected on Monday.\n\nWhen there is an extreme heat event occurring with wildfire smoke, prioritize keeping cool.\n\nThese conditions pose a health risk when you are not used to the heat.\n\nEveryone is at risk from heat, especially older adults; infants and young children; and people with chronic illnesses.\n\nYou are advised to 1) drink plenty of cool liquids before feeling thirsty; and 2) keep cool by dressing for the weather and spending more time in a cool place.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
