    "description": "\nSqualls with wind gusts up to 40 knots, frequent lightning and poor to very poor visibility in showers heavy at times are expected or occurring in the area.\n\nAn area of thunderstorms is moving southeast at 30 knots and will affect the region over the next couple of hours.\n\n###\n\nPoor to very poor visibility may contribute to voyage delays and make marine navigation hazardous. Proceed with caution as visibility may suddenly be reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. For more information monitor Canadian Coast Guard radio or Weatheradio stations.\n",
    "instruction": "\nMariners are advised to prepare for squalls. If underway, seek safe harbour immediately. If you must travel, keep others informed of your planned route and carry appropriate safety equipment including a GPS and satellite phone or marine radio.\n",
