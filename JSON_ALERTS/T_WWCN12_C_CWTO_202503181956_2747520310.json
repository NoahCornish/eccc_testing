    "description": "\nA winter storm is expected beginning Wednesday.\n\nWhat: \nTotal snowfall amounts of 20 to 40 cm. \nPeak snowfall rates of 3 to 5 cm per hour. \nPoor visibility in heavy snow and local blowing snow. \n\nWhen: \nBeginning Wednesday afternoon and tapering off Thursday evening. \n\nAdditional information: \nHeavy snow is expected to begin Wednesday afternoon. Northerly winds gusting to 50 km/h will result in areas of blowing snow, further reducing visibility.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
