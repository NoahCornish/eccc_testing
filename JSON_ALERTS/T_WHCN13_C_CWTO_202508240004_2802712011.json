    "description": "\nSqualls with wind gusts up to 35 knots and waterspout activity are expected or occurring in the area.\n\nThunderstorms along a cold front are crossing southern Lake Huron. Some of these storms are capable of producing wind gusts to 35 knots along with sizeable hail.\n\n###\n\nIf conditions become favourable for the development of tornadoes, tornado watches or tornado warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. For more information monitor Canadian Coast Guard radio or Weatheradio stations.\n",
    "instruction": "\nMariners are advised to prepare for squalls. If underway, seek safe harbour immediately. Should one or more waterspouts develop nearby, circumnavigate away from the waterspouts and head for shore or the nearest safe harbour if possible. Consider delaying or postponing travel in areas under the squall warning.\n",
