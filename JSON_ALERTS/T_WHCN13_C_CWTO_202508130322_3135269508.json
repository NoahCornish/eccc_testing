    "description": "\nConditions are favourable for the development of squalls with wind gusts up to 35 knots and poor to very poor visibility in thunderstorms heavy at times.\n\n###\n\nPoor to very poor visibility may contribute to voyage delays and make marine navigation hazardous.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. For more information monitor Canadian Coast Guard radio or Weatheradio stations.\n",
    "instruction": "\nMariners are advised to prepare for potential squalls. Vulnerable vessels are most at risk and should seek safe harbour if underway.\n",
