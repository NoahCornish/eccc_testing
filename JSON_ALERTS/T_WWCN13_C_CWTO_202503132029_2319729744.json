    "description": "\nWinter storm conditions possible on Saturday.\n\nWhat: \nTotal snowfall amounts near 15 cm possible. \nPoor visibility in snow and blowing snow.\nRisk of freezing rain. \n\nWhen: \nEarly Saturday morning into Saturday night.\n\nAdditional information: \nA Colorado low could bring a wintry mix of precipitation across the region on Saturday. The precipitation is expected to begin as rain in some areas with amounts of 10 of 20 mm possible. The rain is expected to become mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain, then transition to snow which could be heavy at times. Northerly wind gusts up to 50 km/h could result in blowing snow. The track of this low pressure system is still somewhat uncertain which will affect exact snowfall amounts and precipitation types.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
