    "description": "\nHeavy snow is forecast.\n\nWhat:\nLocal snowfall amounts of 15 cm. Higher snowfall amounts are possible.\nRisk of freezing rain.\n\nWhen:\nSunday morning into Sunday evening.\n\nAdditional information:\nA Texas Low will track across the area and a narrow area of significant snow is expected, with a sharp difference in snowfall amounts west to east. For areas that exhibit rain, freezing rain, or ice pellets mixing in, snowfall amounts will be reduced.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
    "instruction": "\nIf visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop. Take frequent breaks and avoid strain when clearing snow.\n",
