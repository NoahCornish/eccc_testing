    "description": "\nA prolonged period of heat and humidity continues.\n\nWhat:\nDaytime highs of 29 to 32 degrees Celsius and a humidex of 35 to 40.\nOvernight lows of 19 to 21 degrees Celsius, providing little relief from the heat.\n\nWhen:\nContinuing through Thursday.\n\nAdditional information:\nGatineau will continue to experience hot and humid conditions through Thursday.

As appropriate, follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages or caffeine; \nIf you can, spend at least 2 hours a day in an air conditioned or cool place;\nTake at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activities;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on and be ready to help your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable, disabled, mentally ill or live alone.\n\nRemember that heat can also affect the health of pets.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health, call Info-Santé by dialling 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of an emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, see the Portail santé mieux-être du gouvernement du Québec at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca/en.\n\n###\n\nFor more information: https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/climate-change-health/extreme-heat/how-protect-yourself.html https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/climate-change-health/extreme-heat/who-is-at-risk.html\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

    "instruction": "\nTake action to protect yourself and others – extreme heat can affect everyone’s health. Determine if you or others around you are at greater risk of heat illness. Check on older adults, those living alone and other at-risk people in-person or on the phone multiple times a day.\n\nWatch for the early signs of heat exhaustion in yourself and others. Signs may include headache, nausea, dizziness, thirst, dark urine and intense fatigue. Stop your activity and drink water. \n\nHeat stroke is a medical emergency! Call 9-1-1 or your emergency health provider if you, or someone around you, is showing signs of heat stroke which can include red and hot skin, dizziness, nausea, confusion and change in consciousness. While you wait for medical attention, try to cool the person by moving them to a cool place, removing extra clothing, applying cold water or ice packs around the body.\n\nDrink water often and before you feel thirsty to replace fluids. \n\nClose blinds, or shades and open windows if outside is cooler than inside. \n\nTurn on air conditioning, use a fan, or move to a cooler area of your living space. If your living space is hot, move to a cool public space such as a cooling centre, community centre, library or shaded park. \n\nFollow the advice of your region’s public health authority.\n\nPlan and schedule outdoor activities during the coolest parts of the day. \n\nLimit direct exposure to the sun and heat. Wear lightweight, light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and a wide-brimmed hat. \n\nNever leave people, especially children, or pets inside a parked vehicle. Check the vehicle before locking to make sure no one is left behind.\n",
