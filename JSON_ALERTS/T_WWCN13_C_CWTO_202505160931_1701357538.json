    "description": "\nIce build-up due to freezing rain today.\n\nWhat:\nLong duration freezing rain. \n2 to 5 mm of ice accretion.\n\nWhen:\nBeginning early this morning and ending late this afternoon, with the possibility of a risk of freezing rain lasting into this evening.\n\nAdditional information:\nLight snow is expected to transition to freezing rain or ice pellets early this morning. While precipitation is expected to remain light, the long duration of the freezing rain means that ice accretion of up to 5 mm is possible. Freezing rain could at times be mixed with ice pellets, especially this afternoon, which could affect the total amount of ice build-up. Freezing rain is expected to change over to ice pellets or snow this evening, \n\nSurfaces such as walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nBeware of electrical wires that could break under the weight of ice.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
