    "description": "\nConditions are favourable for the development of squalls with wind gusts up to 40 knots, frequent lightning and poor to very poor visibility in showers heavy at times.\n\nThunderstorms are expected to track northeast across the area over the next few hours. The squall threat should end this morning.\n\n###\n\nProceed with caution as visibility may suddenly be reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. For more information monitor Canadian Coast Guard radio or Weatheradio stations.\n",
    "instruction": "\nVessels without lightning protection should make their way to shore immediately. Mariners are advised to prepare for potential squalls. Vulnerable vessels are most at risk and should seek safe harbour if underway. Consider delaying or postponing travel in areas under the Squall Watch.\n",
