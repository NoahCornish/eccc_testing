    "description": "\nWinter weather travel advisory in effect today and this evening.\n\nWhat:\nReduced visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nLocal snowfall accumulations 5 to 10 cm.\n\nWhen:\nNow into this evening.\n\nAdditional information:\nLake effect snow has developed again to the lee of Lake Huron. Along with northwest winds gusting up to 70 km/h, this is resulting in poor visibility in bands of heavy snow and areas of blowing snow. Reduced visibility will be the main concern. Snowfall accumulations are not expected to be significant as the bands move around. The snow bands are expected to weaken or move out of the area tonight.\n\n###\n\nMotorists should expect hazardous winter driving conditions and adjust travel plans accordingly. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Snow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Road closures are possible.\n\nFor road conditions and other traveller information from the Ministry of Transportation, visit https://www.ontario.ca/511, https://www.twitter.com/511Ontario, or call 5-1-1.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
    "instruction": "\nConsider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve. If you must drive, be prepared for areas of poor visibility.\n",
