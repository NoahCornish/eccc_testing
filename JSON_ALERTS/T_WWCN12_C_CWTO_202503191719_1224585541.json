    "description": "\nA winter storm is expected beginning this afternoon.\n\nWhat: \nTotal snowfall amounts of 20 to 40 cm possible. \nFreezing rain with light ice build-up possible.\n\nWhen: \nBeginning this afternoon and tapering off Thursday afternoon. \n\nAdditional information: \nThe risk for scattered flurries, rain showers or possibly freezing drizzle will give way to more organized precipitation this afternoon. Current indications suggest that a rain-snow transition line will stretch from Sault Ste. Marie northeast towards Kirkland Lake. Along this transition line, freezing rain or ice pellets is expected. North of the transition line, precipitation will be heavy snow. South of this line, precipitation will mainly fall as rain. Precipitation is expected to change over to all snow tonight before tapering off Thursday afternoon. \n\nThe position of this rain-snow transition line may still shift north or south which will affect exact precipitation amounts and types.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #ONStorm.\n",
    "instruction": "\nConsider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve. Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions.\n",
